Hi, I'm Aleks :wave: I'm a tenure-track faculty at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de){:target="_blank"} broadly interested in trustworthy machine learning, 
that is models and algorithms that are not only accurate or efficient but also robust, privacy-preserving, fair, uncertainty-aware, interpretable, etc.
<!--  -->

I completed my PhD on machine learning for graphs at the [DAML](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/){:target="_blank"} group at TU Munich, advised by [Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/){:target="_blank"}.
<!-- During my PhD I interned at Google working with the graph mining team. -->
I have a MSc in computer science from TU Munich where I worked at [Rostlab](https://www.rostlab.org/){:target="_blank"} on natural language mutation mentions.
<!-- Before that I studied at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, North Macedonia. -->

**Research interests**: adversarial robustness, provable guarantees, fairness, privacy-preserving machine learning, uncertainty estimation, interpretability, graph neural networks, graph representation learning, and (deep) generative models.
