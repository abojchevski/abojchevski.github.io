<!-- ### PhD/PostDoc Positions -->
We are looking for people with computer science (or related) background interested in **trustworthy machine learning** research. We offer fully-funded **PhD/PostDoc** positions on one or more of the following topics: adversarial robustness (attacks, defenses, certificates), privacy attacks and privacy-preserving learning, algorithmic fairness and bias, uncertainty-aware models, out-of-distribution detection, out-of-domain generalization, and explainability. If you are interested in working with us on these (or adjacent) topics keep reading.
One focus area is on graph-based models such as **graph neural networks** which have emerged as a fundamental building block in many AI systems.

<!-- Why graphs? Because they are everywhere! Neural connections in the brain, molecules, social networks, interactions between proteins, source code, and the structure of the Web seem to be entirely disparate phenomena at a first glance. Yet, if we abstract them as graphs -- simply a set of nodes connected by a set of edges -- we can view and study them through a common lens. Indeed, graph-based machine learning models are used across many domains for various high-impact applications. How can we make them trustworthy? -->

##### Your profile
* A Master (or equivalent) degree in Computer Science or a closely related field
* Knowledge of at least one programming language (preferably Python)
* Background in machine learning and/or data mining is a plus
* Solid mathematical foundation (e.g. probability theory, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra) is a plus
* Experience with frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar is a plus
* For PostDocs: PhD in a closely related area and publications at the following venues: ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, WWW, AAAI, AISTATS

##### Salary
The positions include full benefits and are paid very well according to the collective labor agreement TVÃ¶D: [100% E13](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tvoed/bund?id=tvoed-bund&g=E_13){:target="_blank"} for PhDs (around 4K euros per month before taxes) and [100% E14](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tvoed/bund?id=tvoed-bund&g=E_14){:target="_blank"} for PostDocs (around 4.5K euros per month before taxes).
